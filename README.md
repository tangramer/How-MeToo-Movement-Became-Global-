# How MeToo Movement Became Global?

In this project, we used three visualization methods to clearly visualize the global spread of the MeToo movement.

## World Graph
The world graph visualized the spread of #MeToo
movement over 30 days. Twenty countries and regions
were involved in the movement in a month. Canada was
the first, followed by countries in the mid Asia and
Europe. Japan and China engaged with this movement
eventually in 2017.

## Sentiment Analysis
The overall tone seems to be positive during the first
month of the #MeToo movement. The rapid surge of the
negative tone halfway implies the plausible exposure of
some events or scandals. The feeling of anger,
accompanied with trust, dominate peopleâ€™s sentiment.
These findings sort of denote that expressing sympathy
and showing trust for the victims stimulate the global
transmission of the ##MeToo movement.

## Streamgraph
Streamgraph showed 6 important words appearances
trend during the first month of the #MeToo movement.
We saw #believeyou and #howiwillchange dominated
the first few days and all the words died down after the
first week.
